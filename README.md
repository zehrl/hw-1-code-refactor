## Description

### What was the assignment?

In this assignment, I was tasked to take on the role of a junior front-end developer and help "refactor" code. The project provided was a mock-up of a marketing agency's website with a typical header/body/footer layout (see below).

### Why?

Given the user story of the application, it was my job to improve accessibility of the HTML code to optimize the site for search engines. As an optional task, I condensed the CSS selectors into common groups to make things easier to read.

## How?

**Accessibility**

To improve accessibility, I used the knowledge gained on HTML elements to appropriately select the correct tag. I went through each tag and asked myself, "Is there something more specific or fitting for this piece of the webpage?" Most "div" elements in this assignment needed to be changed.

**Condensing CSS**

To improve "readability" in the stylesheet, I went through the .css file and identified what elements & classes shared identical styling. I then combined the code into one declaration. 

### What did I learn?

In this assignment, I was able to learn about various topics such as:
* Learning to write informative & adequate README files
* Troubleshooting HTML ID link issues
* Correcting HTML element tag usage
* Combining CSS selectors with common properties & values
* Creating a GitHub repository and following standard naming conventions
